# OpprimoBot
OpprimoBot is an AI bot for Starcraft:Broodwar. It uses the BWAPI project to communicate with the Starcraft engine. 
It can play all three races on (almost) all maps, but works best with Terrans.

Opprimobot (and its precursor BTHAI) is developed by Dr. Johan Hagelbäck, Assistant Professor in Artificial Intelligence 
at Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden. You can contact the author at johan.hagelback@gmail.com.

Opprimobot is free to use (MIT license) in your own research or education projects. The only requirement is that if you 
publish anything that is based on Opprimobot (or BTHAI), add the following reference:

Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG), 2012
